  <h2 class="page-title">Research</h2>
  <p>Climate change is not only a complex scientific topic, but an increasingly pressing moral and
political issue. The impact of climate change on human and natural systems in the future,
and the decisions arising from those impacts, primarily rely on climate and Earth system model
projections. It is, therefore, supremely critical to build <em>credible</em> models.</p>
<p>My research is focused on answering the fundamental questions of <em>How confident are we in our
models?</em> and <em>How credible (trusted) are our models in the scientific community?</em> To that end, I
develop tools for ice sheet and Earth system modelers to help them evaluate and understand their
models; and to provide the results of their evaluations to the wider scientific community, stake
holders, and decision makers in a clear and understandable way.</p>
<p>Formally, I use verification and validation (V&amp;V) techniques to help developers build confidence and
insight into their models, and focus on presenting those results in an understandable and contextual
way so that they can be used to build model credibility.</p>
<h3>Building credible ice sheet models</h3>
<p>I’ve am both the technical and visionary lead for <a href="https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit">LIVVKit</a>, a
python based open source and openly developed ice sheet model V&amp;V toolkit, which is intended to both
build user/developer confidence and enhance the credibility of ice sheet models in the wider
scientific community. V&amp;V is a set of formal computer science and mathematics techniques that allow
users/developers (hereafter users) to quantify model confidence and improve user confidence in model
results. LIVVkit allows users to run increasingly sophisticated (and therefore time intensive)
component and model level tests as part of their normal development workflow, with detailed results
of model improvement. This however, does not necessarily help build model credibility within the
scientific community unless those testing results are discoverable by the scientific community, the
methods and analyses are transparent, and the results are provided with the appropriate context so
that they are understandable. To this end, LIVVkit has adopted a free (libre) software structure
where not only is the source code open, but all observational data and an example set of model
output used for the analyses is provided freely. Furthermore, LIVVkit results are provided in a
portable website which can be easily shared and hosted, so that the results can be available to the
scientific community. Importantly, an initial context is provided to help viewers understand the
analyses and references to relevant journal articles describing the data and methods are provided
with each analysis.</p>
<h3>Climate reproducibility</h3>
<p>One of the major concerns in DOE’s Earth system model (<a href="https://e3sm.org/">E3SM</a>) development
community is whether or not model or computing environment changes are changing the modeled climate,
or if the changes fall within the models normal climactic variations. This is critical to E3SM
development because climate-changing model/computing changes require an extensive validation process
before they are integrated into the model. As part of the CMDV Software project (PIs: Dr. Andy
Salinger and Dr. Caldwell), and in partnership with Dr. Mahajan and Dr. Evans at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory we’ve developed <a href="https://github.com/LIVVkit/evv4esm">EVV</a>, a python package to evaluate
the climate statistics of an Earth system model test ensemble against that of a baseline ensemble,
by using several modern machine learning classification algorithms based on non-parametric
(distribution- free) two-sample statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov or K-S test) for
multivariate data. This allows us to classify the equality of the climate ensemble distributions,
where the critical value for rejecting the null hypothesis is determined by using bootstrap
resampling.</p>
<p>EVV is currently being extended to include a other statistical test such as the Enery test,
Crossmatch test, and the Anderson-Darling test which all compare the ensemble distributions in
different ways. Due to the complexity of fully active Earth system model, and the sensitivity of the
climate, there is a massive variety of changes that can result in a different climate, so having
multiple complementary classifiers is necessary for determining the equality of climate
ensembles. Furthermore, other ensemble testing techniques to determine changing climates are being
developed in partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory scientists Dr. Rash, Dr. Singh
and Dr. Wan and will be included in EVV in the future.</p>
