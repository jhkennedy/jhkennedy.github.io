Drainage basins were denoted by Zwally et al. (2012) are numbered in orange, and their colors correspond to those used in other histograms and scatterplots that compare modeled and observed SMB. Altimetry data (white lines) were obtained from the IceBridge project (Lewis et al., 2017) and SMB values along transects represent the annual average from the temporal domain of each transect (the oldest resolvable internal reflecting horizon varies for each airborne radar location, but can reach as far back as the early 1700s). Core/firn estimates are colored based on their source; dark blue circles are locations compiled by Cogley et al. (2004) and updated by Bales et al. (2009) PARCA cores, while yellow triangles are estimates supplied by PROMICE (Machguth et al., 2016). Core data points are sized by the length of their temporal record, with larger points indicating annual estimates were taken from a greater number of yearly SMB values.",
